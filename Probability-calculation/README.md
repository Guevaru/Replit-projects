# Probability Calculator


This Probability Calculator is a Python program that estimates the probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat. It allows you to perform a large number of experiments to approximate the probability.

## Features

- `Hat` class: Represents a hat containing different colored balls. It has methods to initialize the hat with a variable number of balls and to draw balls randomly from the hat.
- `experiment` function: Performs experiments to estimate the probability of drawing a specific group of balls from the hat.
