# Time Calculator

The Time Calculator is a Python program that allows you to add a duration to a given start time and obtain the resulting time. It also provides additional functionalities such as displaying the day of the week and handling scenarios where the result spans multiple days.

Features
Adds a duration time to a start time and returns the result.
Handles both 12-hour clock format (AM/PM) and 24-hour clock format.
Supports specifying the starting day of the week for accurate day calculations.
Displays the resulting time and, if applicable, the day of the week.
Accounts for scenarios where the result may be the next day or multiple days later.
Usage
To use the Time Calculator, follow these steps:

Import the add_time function from the time_calculator module.
Call the add_time function with the required parameters: start time and duration.
Optionally, provide the starting day of the week as an additional parameter.
The function will return the resulting time as a string.
Example usage:

python
Copy code
from time_calculator import add_time

start_time = "3:00 PM"
duration = "3:10"
result = add_time(start_time, duration)
print(result)
Development
The Time Calculator project consists of the following files:

time_calculator.py: Contains the add_time function implementation.
main.py: Provides example usage and test cases for the add_time function.
test_module.py: Contains unit tests for the add_time function.
To develop the project further, you can modify the add_time function in time_calculator.py to enhance its functionality. You can also add more test cases in test_module.py to validate the behavior of the function.

Testing
The project includes a test suite that ensures the correctness of the add_time function. The unit tests are implemented in test_module.py.

To run the tests, execute the test_module.py file. The test results will be displayed, indicating whether each test case passed or failed.

bash
Copy code
python test_module.py
